            <h3>Become an AI Scintist</h3>
            <p>You don't have what we could consider a “standard education” in either AI or CS, despite your deep-domain
                expertise. This is very unconventional in a field where academic pedigree was considered to carry all
                the weight. I'd love to walk through your journey in AI.</p>
